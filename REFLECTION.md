Reflection
==========

When I first started this project, my Javascript knowledge was very limited. I had never used Javascript
until the start of this unit. Because of this, I struggled very hard to start this project. However,
I decided to look back on the practicals I had done in class and downloaded some code from Github in the
hopes that I could find something to help me get started on writing an API.

One of the big problems that I had ran into was that I could not get the uploaded images to save to the
local drive. This was because of the system security that would not let websites modify anything on the
users drive. To get around this, I had found that multer could be used to save the image via a POST
function. Implementing this was fairly simple as there were a lot of tutorials online that I could use as
a reference.

Another problem that I ran into was how I could display the images one by one like a carousel. I could not
find anything online that could produce what I wanted so I had to improvise. My solution to this was to use
the display: none css tag to hide all the images from the display panel and write a function in the API to
display an image one at a one using display: block.

There are still quite a few bugs in the web application that I could not fix in time, however the major ones
have been resolved.

Overall, I have taught myself a lot on this unit. Along the way, I have improved a lot on my
programming skills. I have learnt how to code using the best practices and learnt how to manage
different iterations of my project using Github. I now understand the fundamentals of Javascript
and understand how data between the client and server is exchanged.

I had used the ws_api Github repository as my starting block at the beginning of this project and
if I were to start this project again, I would feel confident on writing an API from scratch without
needing a reference.

I plan on continuing this project even after submission as I know that my skills can be further improved.
I look forwards to learning more about Javascript and improving my web application.
